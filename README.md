# Date All Day

The Date All Day project adds 'All Day' functionality to date fields,
including an 'All Day' theme and 'All Day' checkboxes for the 
Date select and Date popup widgets.

Additionally, this module serves as an example of how other modules can inject 
new functionality into date fields using various hooks provided by Date and by 
the Field API.

This module is a port to Backdrop of one part of the Drupal project 'Date'.
